/* From CSS Version 3, there are five main ways to reference a color.

By RGB value,

By RGBA value,

By HSL value,

By hex value and

By predefined color names. */ 

/*
RGB value

RGB is a color model that adds the colors red (R), green (G) and blue (B) together to create colors. This is based on how the human eye sees colors.

Each value is defined as a number between 0 and 255, representing the intensity of that color.

For example, the color red would have the RGB value of 255,0,0 since the intensity of the red color would be 100% while blue and green would be 0%.

The color black then would be 0,0,0 and the color white 255,255,255.

When using RGB values in CSS, they can be defined using the rgb keyword:
*/
p { 
    color: rgb(255, 0, 0); 
  }

/*
RGBA value

RGBA is an extension of RGB that add an alpha (A) channel. The alpha channel represents the opacity, or transparency, of the color.

Similar to RGB, this is specified in CSS using the rgba keyword:
*/

p { 
    color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.7); 
  }

  /*
  HSL value

    HSL is a newer color model defined as Hue (H), Saturation (S) and Lightness (L). 
    The aim of the model is to simplify mental visualization of the color that the value represents.

    Think of a rainbow that has been turned into a full circle. 
    This represents the Hue. The Hue value is the degree value on this circle, 
    from 0 degrees to 360 degrees. 0 is red, 120 is green and 240 is blue.
    Saturation is the distance from the center of the circle to its edge. 

    The saturation value is represented by a percentage from 0% to 100% where 0% 
    is the center of the circle and 100% is its edge. For example, 0% will mean that the 
    color is more grey and 100% represents the full color.

    Lightness is the third element of this color model. 
    Think of it as turning the circle into a 3D cylinder where 
    the bottom of the cylinder is more black and toward the top is more white. 
    Therefore, lightness is the distance from the bottom of the cylinder to the top. 
    Again, lightness is represented by a percentage from 0% to 100% where 0% is the 
    bottom of the cylinder and 100% is its top. In other words, 0% will mean that the 
    color is more black and 100% is white.  

    In CSS, you use the hsl keyword to define a color with HSL.

        color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%);
